At this point you should be able to click on the green triangle button next to your AVD to launch it.
--> For a local device, You will need to enable USB Debugging on your device in order to install your app during development. To enable USB debugging on your device, you will first need to enable the "Developer options" menu by going to Settings → About phone → Software information and then tapping the Build number row at the bottom seven times. You can then go back to Settings → Developer options to enable "USB debugging". Go ahead and plug in your device via USB to your development machine.
